# CFG-Python-Solutions
As a lead instructor for a few Code First Girls (CF:G) Python courses, I often get requests for solutions to some of the homework questions.

This repository aims to compile and provide those solutions so that I won't have to continue re-writing them. This also makes it a whole lot more accesible for students in case they don't want to explicitly ask for help or if they're working at a pace faster than everyone else.

A lot of these questions are fairly straight forward, however, others can be solved in numerous ways. The methods I have chosen to use are in line with each session's topics and are not too complex. All solutions include comments that hopefully explain the solution's logic well.

**Note:** Feel free to fork this repository and make your own modifications if you need to (suggestions for updates are also always welcome)!
